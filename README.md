# Financial Dashboard
Analysts meander the web trying to find quality, real-time data to assist in their decision making processes.  It's time consuming and effortful.  You could pay $20,000 for a Bloomberg terminal or you could create your own, and that's what we did!

We created a dashboard which displays an overview of various financial instruments and data.  
- The Macro tab displays charts on Debt/GDP ratio, Dow/Gold ratio, Gold/Silver ratio, Real estate/Gold, Gold/Monetary base, S&P/Real estate, ISM manufacturing index, Unemployment, Commodities, CPI, Retail Sales, Velocity, Yield curve, Dollar index (DXY), and Bitcoin/Cryptocurrencies.  
- The Micro tab tab provides company information, financial ratios, and other key metrics for the equity specified by the user. 
- The ML/AI tab returns company stock price information and predicts volatility and stock price movement.
